# Changelog

All notable changes to Understoria will be documented in this
file. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project adheres roughly to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Pre-1.0 releases may
include breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Agent 3 task 2 — Federation pull loop.** Server-to-server
  replication of the signed exchange ledger. Nodes can now be
  configured (via comma-separated `PEER_NODE_URLS`) to periodically
  pull `GET /exchanges?since=` from peers. Each pulled row goes
  through the same `verifyExchange` check as the POST endpoint
  (a peer cannot inject anything unsigned) and is deduped by id.
  Pulled rows retain their original `nodeId` — federation is
  replication of a signed ledger, not re-attribution. New
  per-peer state table (server schema v2) tracks `lastPulledAt`,
  `lastSuccessAt`, `lastCompletedAt`, `lastError`, and
  `lastPulledCount` for observability via the new public
  `GET /peers` endpoint (peer URLs are inherently public; no
  member counts or operational config). The pull worker is a thin
  shell over `pullFromPeer()` — the pure function takes an
  injectable `fetcher`, making the whole flow testable without
  network. Default pull interval 5 minutes, configurable via
  `PEER_PULL_INTERVAL_MS`. Agent 15 (federation governance) will
  replace env-var peer config with signed federation agreements
  per the roadmap.
- **Agent 11 — Node configuration & local rules.** First proper
  stage of the Ostrom track. The three safeguard thresholds that
  used to live as constants in `apps/web/src/lib/safeguards.ts`
  (`dailyHelperLimit`, `shortExchangeHours`, `reciprocalPairThreshold`)
  are now read from a per-node `NodeConfig` persisted in a new
  Dexie table (schema v6, single row keyed by `nodeId`). Defaults
  match the pre-Agent-11 PWA exactly, so behaviour is unchanged
  for a community that never opens settings. New "Community
  settings" section on Profile with input + validation (range
  checks live in `db/nodeConfig.ts`, not the component, so the
  same rules apply to any future caller — governance proposals,
  peer sync) and a "Reset to defaults" action. The UI carries an
  explicit yellow note that the affordance is a bootstrap measure
  until Agent 13 (in-app governance) routes edits through a
  proposal. `assertWithinDailyLimit()` and `evaluateSafeguards()`
  now take an optional `NodeConfig` parameter and fall back to
  `DEFAULT_NODE_CONFIG` — every existing call site continues to
  work; the `confirmExchange` flow passes the live config through.
  Server-side: new `GET /config` endpoint returns an
  operator/hosting transparency block (`name`, `fundingNote`,
  `contact`) when any of the new `OPERATOR_*` env vars are set,
  or `{}` otherwise. The folded-in transparency block from the
  original "Beyond Ostrom" Agent 21; deliberately a small surface
  (no member counts, no node id, no operational config).
- **Agent 18a — Breadth & reciprocity Dashboard.** Two new sections
  on the Dashboard, both rendered without external charting
  libraries: a *breadth bar* listing members by how many distinct
  people they've helped (rewards distribution, not volume — never
  shows hours per person), and a *reciprocity pulse* showing what
  fraction of community connections flow both ways. Both sections
  include empty states and a footnote making clear that this is a
  window into the shape of help, not a score. New "Weaver"
  achievement awarded when a member's exchanges span 3+ distinct
  location zones (the counterparty's `locationZone`); computed at
  exchange-confirmation time. New pure `lib/flow.ts` module
  separated from `lib/stats.ts` because it answers a different
  question (relational distribution vs. aggregate totals). All UI
  strings i18n'd in en + es; parity test passes. The community web
  graph (original Agent 18b) is *not* shipped — it remains gated
  on a threat-model §7 entry and a governance opt-in per the
  roadmap.
- **Agent 16 — Onboarding & political literacy.** Four-screen
  welcome flow at `/welcome` shown once on first launch, marked
  via `SETTING_KEYS.onboarded` (which existed in the schema since
  v0.1.0 but was never read or written). Screens cover: timebank
  semantics, seed credit, cryptographic identity, community
  authority. New "Learn" section in Profile with three actions:
  revisit the welcome flow, expand an in-app condensed member
  guide, expand the 13 study-group prompts mirrored from
  `docs/political-education/README.md` with copy-for-meeting
  support. Existing pilot devices (any device with members already
  in IndexedDB) are silently backfilled as onboarded so they don't
  see a welcome flow for software they already know. `/invite` is
  allow-listed pre-onboarding so invited members can still land
  on the redemption screen first. UI strings i18n'd in English and
  Spanish (8 new keys × 2 locales = 16; parity test passes). The
  member guide and study prompts live as TS content files rather
  than i18n locales per the roadmap's i18n-debt failure mode:
  long-form prose translation is a separate workstream from UI
  string translation.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`, the `DCO` file (Developer Certificate of
  Origin v1.1), `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability disclosure policy),
  GitHub issue and pull-request templates, a CI workflow, and a
  commit-msg hook template. AGPL-3.0-or-later header on every
  source file.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — canonical agent-by-agent work plan, including
  the new **Phase 5 (Commons governance)** built on Elinor Ostrom's
  design principles. Adds Agents 11 – 15 (node configuration,
  moderation & sanctions, in-app proposals, dispute resolution,
  federation governance) with a staged ordering: Agent 11 first
  (grounded in issue #6), then finish Agent 3, then 13 + 14 as one
  surface, then 12 once telemetry exists, then 15 once peers
  federate in practice.
- Roadmap revision integrating a "Beyond Ostrom" proposal (Kerala,
  Zapatista, potlatch, Mondragon, Haudenosaunee, Cooperation Jackson
  traditions). Result: two new standalone agents (**Agent 16 —
  onboarding & political literacy**, **Agent 18a — breadth +
  reciprocity Dashboard**); reversibility tiers + impact reflection
  + operator transparency folded into Agents 13 and 11 respectively;
  co-organizer support routed through Agent 10 Phase 3; organizer
  recall + pool allocations routed through the Agent 13 Decisions
  surface; community web graph (18b), balance cap + community pool
  (19), and federation mutual aid fund (21) deferred behind explicit
  gates documented in the roadmap.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-16

First development release. Two deployable artifacts: a React PWA
and an optional Fastify community node, both AGPL-3.0-or-later.

### Added

**Core PWA (Agent 1)**
- Community Board with Needs / Offers tabs, category and urgency
  filters, search, floating post buttons
- Post → claim → dual-confirm → credit exchange flow
- Time-credit system with 5-hour seed balance per member; balances
  derived from event-sourced exchange log
- Community Dashboard with total hours, active members, solidarity
  streak, category breakdown bars, milestone progress
- Six achievements as community roles (First Exchange, Connector,
  Regular, Bridge Builder, Seed Planter, Listener)
- Profile page with balance, editable skills / availability / area,
  exchange history, signed records, data export, dev member
  switcher
- PWA manifest + service worker via vite-plugin-pwa, mobile-first
  layout, 44 px touch targets, dark mode

**Crypto & Identity (Agent 2)**
- Ed25519 keypair identity via tweetnacl — no email / phone /
  external IdP
- Signed exchange transactions with canonical JSON payload,
  independently verifiable
- Cryptographic single-use invite tokens with 14-day expiry and
  issuer revocation
- Web-of-trust vouching: two distinct voucher keys promotes
  `pending_trust` → `trusted`
- Passphrase-wrapped private keys (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 600k
  iterations + NaCl secretbox) with explicit "no recovery"
  semantics

**Federation & Infrastructure (Agent 3 — partial)**
- Fastify community node (`apps/server/`) with `GET /health`,
  `POST /exchanges` (verifies signatures, persists), and
  `GET /exchanges?since=&limit=` for federation pull
- `better-sqlite3` storage with versioned migrations, WAL mode,
  indexes for federation queries
- Helmet (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy), Fastify
  rate-limit keyed by an FNV-1a bucket of the IP (no IPs in logs)
- Multi-stage Dockerfile + `docker-compose.yml`, runs as non-root,
  drops every Linux capability, read-only filesystem, tini as PID 1

**Security & Opsec (Agent 4 — partial)**
- Threat model (`docs/threat-model.md`) with adversaries, mitigations,
  tracked gaps, per-PR review questions
- Member-facing opsec guide (`docs/opsec-guide.md`)
- Panic button: soft purge (anonymize while preserving the signed
  ledger and keypair) and hard purge (wipe everything, rotate node
  identity)
- Anti-gaming safeguards: configurable daily exchange limit and
  advisory flags for short / reciprocal patterns

**Governance & Cooperative Design (Agent 5 — partial)**
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` with restorative-justice conflict resolution
- `GOVERNANCE.md` (modified consensus, three-month role rotation,
  moderation with appeals)
- `TRADEMARK.md` (AGPL-the-code, protect-the-name)

**Documentation (Agent 9 — partial)**
- `docs/member-guide.md`, `docs/organizer-guide.md`,
  `docs/operator-guide.md` (incl. Caddy reverse-proxy config, Docker
  + Raspberry Pi notes, env var reference)
- `docs/developer-guide.md` (architecture, design patterns, module
  map)
- `docs/political-education/README.md` (reading list, 10 discussion
  prompts, 90-minute workshop outline)
- `docs/quickstart.md` (Debian 13 VM walkthrough)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Internationalization (Agent 9 task 6)**
- `i18next` + `react-i18next` + browser language detector
- Full English source and bootstrap-quality Spanish translation
  marked for native-speaker review
- Parity test asserts identical key sets across locales
- Language switcher in Profile

**PWA → community node mirror**
- Per-device "Community node" config in Profile with URL + toggle
- Finalized exchanges enqueued atomically with the exchange itself
  into a durable outbox, then delivered by a retry worker with
  exponential backoff (4 s × 2^attempts, capped at 5 min)
- Permanent failures (`422`, `400`) poisoned; transient
  (5xx / 408 / 429 / network) retried
- "Pending" and "Poisoned" count chips, "Retry now" button in
  Profile

### Testing

- 148 web + 14 server = **162 vitest tests passing** at v0.1.0
- Verified end-to-end on a fresh Debian 13 VM in GNOME Boxes:
  install → PWA → node → mirror → cross-host POST → signature
  round-trip

### Known gaps (tracked work)

See `docs/threat-model.md` §7 and the in-flight roadmap in
`README.md`. Highlights:

- E2E messaging (Agent 2 task 5)
- Cross-node federation pull loop (Agent 3 task 2)
- Posts / vouches / invites endpoints on the server
- Native-speaker review of Spanish strings
- Agent 7 (Organizing Integration) not started
- Agent 10 (Community Projects & Momentum) not started
